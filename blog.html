                <h1>How to Stay Calm and Cool When You Are Extremely Stressed</h1>

            </div>
            
            <div class="text">
                <p class="paragraph1">Being in a hurry all the time drains your energy. Your work and routine life make you feel overwhelmed. Getting caught up in things beyond your control stresses you out…

                    If you’d like to stay cool in stressful situations, here’s how stay calm in <b>5 quick steps:</b> </p>

                <h2>1. Breathe</h2>
                <p>The next time you’re faced with a stressful situation that makes you want to hurry, stop what you’re doing for one minute and perform the following steps:

                    Take five deep breaths in and out (your belly should come forward with each inhale).
                    Imagine all that stress leaving your body with each exhale.
                    Smile. Fake it if you have to. It’s pretty hard to stay grumpy with a goofy grin on your face.
                    Feel free to repeat the above steps every few hours at work or home if you need to.</p>
                    
                <h2>2. Loosen up</h2>
                <p>After your breathing session, perform a quick body scan to identify any areas that are tight or tense. Clenched jaw? Rounded shoulders? Anything else that isn’t at ease?

                </p>    
                <p>Gently touch or massage any of your body parts that are under tension to encourage total relaxation. It might help to imagine you’re in a place that calms you: a beach, hot tub, or nature trail, for example.

                </p>

                <h2>3. Chew Slowly</h2>
                <p>Slow down at the dinner table if you want to learn to be patient and lose weight. Shoveling your food down as fast as you can is a surefire way to eat more than you need to (and find yourself with a bellyache).</p>
                <p>Be a mindful eater who pays attention to the taste, texture, and aroma of every dish. Chew slowly while you try to guess all of the ingredients that were used to prepare your dish.

                </p>
                <p>Chewing slowly will also reduce those dreadful late-night cravings that sneak up on you after work.

                </p>

                <h2>4. Let Go</h2>
                <p>Cliche as it sounds, it’s very effective.

                </p>
                <p>The thing that seems like the end of the world right now?

                </p>
                <p>It’s not. Promise.

                </p>
                <p>Stressing and worrying about the situation you’re in won’t do any good because you’re already in it, so just let it go.

                </p>
                <p>Letting go isn’t easy, so here’s a guide to help you: 21 Things To Do When You Find It Hard To Let Go

                </p>

                <h2>5. Enjoy the Journey</h2>
                <p>Focusing on the end result can quickly become exhausting.

                </p>
                <p>Chasing a bold, audacious goal that’s going to require a lot of time and patience? Split it into several mini-goals so you’ll have several causes for celebration.

                </p>

                <p>Stop focusing on the negative thoughts. Giving yourself consistent positive feedback will help you grow patience, stay encouraged, and find more joy in the process of achieving your goals.

            <h1>How to be study better</h1>

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph1">Study isn't just for the night before an assignment's due or the night before an exam.

           <b>It's never too early  – or too late – to develop good study habits. </b>The sooner you get into a good study groove, the easier everything will be and the more your chances of getting good marks will improve.
            
            Here are our top tips for getting the most out of study. </p>

        <h2>1. Pick a place and time</h2>

        <p>Everyone has their own idea about the best place and time to study. Whether it's your bedroom at night or the library after school, find a study space and a regular study time that works for you and stick with it.

        </p>

        <p><b>Set up your study space</b> – Your study space should be quiet, comfortable and distraction-free. It should make you feel happy and inspired. Decorate it with your favourite pictures or objects. If you want to listen to music or burn incense, pick a space that lets you do that.</p>
        <p><b>Find your best time</b> – Some people work better in the morning. Others work better at night. Work out which time suits you and plan to study then. Don't study much later than your usual bedtime – pushing yourself late at night can make you too tired to study properly.</p>

        <h2>2. Study every day</h2>
        <p>If you study a little bit every day you'll be continually reviewing things in your mind. This helps you understand things. It also helps you avoid the stress of last-minute cramming.

        </p>
        <p>Early in the year an hour or two a night might be enough to stay on top of things. Later in the year you might need to study more each day.

        </p>
        <p>If you're finding it hard to find time to study, cut back on some (but not all!) of your other activities. Prioritising study might mean spending less time online, or it might mean cutting back on shifts at work, or giving weekend sport a miss for a while.

        </p>

        <h2>3. Plan your time
        </h2>

        <p>It helps to have some plans in motion so you can make the most of your study time.

        </p>

        <p><b>Set alarms</b> – Set alarms to remind you about your study plans. A regular reminder keeps you honest and your plans on track.</p>

        <p><b>Use a wall planner</b> – Stick a calendar or wall planner up so you can see it whenever you're studying. Mark it up with important dates, like exams and assignment due dates. Use it to block out your regular study timetable too.</p>
        <p><b>Make to-do lists</b> – Lists break tasks down into manageable chunks. At the start of the week, make a list of the things that you need to have done by the end of the week. Make a to-do list at the start of each study session too, so that you're clear about what you need to be doing with your time. </p>
        <p><b>Set time limits</b> – Before you start your study session, have a look at your to-do list and give yourself a set time to spend on each task. If you don't get something done in the set time, consider whether it's the best use of your time to keep going with it, or to start working on something else.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Discover your learning style
        </h2>

        <p>Most of us have a preferred way of learning. Get to know the learning style you're most comfortable with and study in the ways you learn best.

        </p>
        <p>Note that these styles are just a way to think about diffent studying techniques – they're not hard and fast rules that say you should only study in one way. Try each of these out and see which ways you prefer.

        </p>

        <p><b>Auditory learners</b> prefer to learn by listening. Try reading your notes aloud and discussing them with other people. You might like to record key points and play them back.
        </p>

        <p><b>Visual learners</b> prefer to learn by seeing. Try using colours in your notes and draw diagrams to help represent key points. You could try to remember some ideas as images.</p>

        <p><b>Tactile/kinesthetic learners</b> prefer to learn by doing. Try using techniques like role-playing or building models to revise key points.</p>
